If you use bubblewrap backend, and the host system is Ubuntu, you may randomly get the following error when you try to run `man`:
```
man: error while loading shared libraries: libmandb-*.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

Sometimes:
```
man: error while loading shared libraries: liblesspipe-*.so: cannot open shared object file: Permission denied
```

This is due to [AppArmor protecting the path /usr/bin/man](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=994030). AppArmor has no idea of Linux kernel namespace, so as long as your executable file is located at `/usr/bin/man`, even if inside a chroot environment, AppArmor still tries to restrict what dynamic libraries it can load. Interestingly, this protection is only sometimes effective.

Obviously, you donâ€™t have permission to change host AppArmor configuration. The workaround is to copy it into another path:
```
cp /usr/bin/man /usr/local/bin/man
```
Remember to do this every time when the package `man-db` or `mandoc` receives a version upgrade.
